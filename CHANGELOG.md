# ShakeIt Photo ChangeLog

## Development (3.2.6)

### Fixes

- **Fix broken link to the Shake It Photo Tutorial.** Upon initial
  installation, the app would link to a tutorial. However, this link was
  broken. **Test this by** doing a fresh installation of
  ShakeIt and confirming that an option to view a tutorial video is provided,
  and that tapping the offered tutorial opens a video.  Thank you to [Tom Lee]
  for [his generous
  contribution](https://github.com/zinc-collective/mp-shake-it-photo/pull/10).


### Enhancements

- **Improve support for larger sized and notched screens.** Since the
  release of the the larger iPhone screens, ShakeIt Photo has had gaps
  between the application interface and the larger devices bezels. With
  the iPhone X, ShakeIt Photo had not taken into account the "Notch" in our
  user interface design. **Test this by** using ShakeIt Photo as
  usual, and keep an eye out for places where the App UI is occluded by
  hardware or OS UI elements, or where there is significant whitespace (or
  blackspace) between applicaiton UI elements and your devices top or
  bottom edge. Thank you to [Tom Lee] for [his generous
  contribution](https://github.com/zinc-collective/mp-shake-it-photo/pull/12)

### Changes

- **Adopt the Prosperity License and publicly release the source code.** The
  Cooperative has decided that it is safe for us to release ShakeIt Photo's
  source code publicly under a non-commercial license, so that folks who want to
  perform maintenance, submit enhancements, or fix issues can do so. Thank you to
  [Zee Spencer] for [his generous
  contribution](https://github.com/zinc-collective/mp-shake-it-photo/commit/c52c73f2cda24385acd977b6cefe0f97b63087a8)

- **Apply changes to comply with Polaroid brand guidelines.** As part of our
  agreement with Polaroid, we must comply with their brand regulations. Thank
  you to [Tom Lee] for [his generous
  contribution](https://github.com/zinc-collective/mp-shake-it-photo/pull/2)
